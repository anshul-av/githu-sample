Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[8][9]
